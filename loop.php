<?php

for($wwe = 0; $wwe <= 10; $wwe++){
    echo 'Number ' . $wwe . '<br>';
}
// ok i get it so for loops is if the variable like this $ww is eqal to lets say 100 the condtion is if wwe is less than or  eqal to 100 then we minus from wee and hat will make youre code crash by the way but either way at the end we echo out our variable 
// what it means is *for* is the lopp so for when wwe is eqal to 0 and wee is less than or equal to 100 the we want wwe to minus by a 100
